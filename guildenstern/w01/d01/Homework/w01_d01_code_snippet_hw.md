## Week 1 Day 1 Code Snippets

One of the most helpful tools when first learning to code is articulating in plain English what a puzzling piece of code does for you. This is because the act of researching and expressing the code's purpose in your own words helps ingrain that purpose in your mind. That said, your homework tonight is to identify the commands you used today and in your prework and mindfully break them down.

#### Objectives

* develop a strategy for breaking down and documenting unfamiliar code
* gain experience using Markdown, the open-source formatting language
* gain practical experience using Git for version control
* gain muscle memory for making frequent, sensible commits

#### Directions:

1. If you haven't, use the command line to create a directory on your desktop called `markdown_assignments`. Within this directory, touch a new file called `code_snippet_breakdowns.md`.

1. Identify 10 commands from the terminal and/or git that you have trouble remembering or that you would like to understand further. List these commands in `code_snippet_breakdowns.md`.

1. Research each command, and provide a description of each command's purpose *in your own words*. If you have issues remembering a particular command, come up with a mnemonic or analogy to help and add it to the description. 

1. Format the code snippet as a code, and the description as standard text.

    * __Example:__ `ls -a` is a terminal command that outputs a list of *all* the files in a given directory. The `-a` flag means I want to see not just the regular files, but the hidden files as well. 

#### Bonus

Create a table layout for your code snippets, [as seen here](https://gist.github.com/vanderhoop/0356c9489ccba09ffc5a).
